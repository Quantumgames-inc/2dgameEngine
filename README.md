#### 2D cross-platform game editor

Quantum Engine is a simple web HTML5 cross-platform game editor (based on [ZICA.js](https://github.com/zica39/ZICA.js)) to create 2D games & apps without programming. It provides a comprehensive set of common
tools, so that users can focus on making games easy (with just a few clicks).
But also supports scripting for advanced users. Games can be exported in one click to a number of platforms, including
desktop platforms (Linux, Mac OSX, Windows), mobile
(Android) and web-based (HTML5) platforms.
